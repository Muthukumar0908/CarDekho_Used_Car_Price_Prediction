Technologies: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visualization and Machine Learning
Domain: Automobile

Problem Statement:

The primary objective of is project is to create a data science solution for predicting used car prices accurately by analyzing a diverse dataset including car model, no. of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, features and location. The aim is to build a machine learning model that offers users to find current valuations for used cars.

Data Understanding

The Dataset contains multiple excel files, each represents its city, columns in each excel gives you an overview of each car, its details, specification and available features.

Data Collected From: https://www.cardekho.com/usedCars

Feature Description Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hxW7IvCX5806H0IsG2Zg9WnVIpr2ZPueB4AElMTokGs/edit

Approach:
  Import data from all excel files
  Examine the structure of each dataset component (New Car Detail, New Car Overview, etc.).
  Check for missing values, outliers, data types and other statistical inference.
Data Preprocessing:
  Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing values appropriately.
  Feature Engineering: Extract relevant information from features like age, mileage, and others.
  Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques.
  Normalization/Scaling: Scale numerical features to bring them to a comparable range.
  Exploratory Data Analysis: Create visualizations to understand the distribution of target variables (used car prices) and relationships between features.
  Choose regression models suitable for predicting continuous values
  Model Evaluation: Use suitable metrics 
  Fine-tune Hyperparameters: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve performance.
  Feature Importance: Analyze feature importance to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.
